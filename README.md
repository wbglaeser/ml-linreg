## Rust Regression Algorithms

This repo contains code for a small rust application that runs a number of simple
regression algorithms. There exist a whole range of statistical software tools designed
to perform regression tasks with precision and speed. This project was designed to
both understand algorithmic solutions to common optimisation problems such as matrix
decompositions as well as well data handling capacities with rust language.
